# Design and Planning

Design and plan: $ARGUMENTS

## Purpose

Collaborative exploration phase before creating issues. Ask questions to understand requirements, present findings from codebase research, and help organize the work into implementable pieces.

## Process

1. **Clarify the problem space**
    - What player experience are we creating?
    - What constraints or requirements exist?
    - What's in scope and out of scope?

2. **Research and present findings**
    - Show relevant existing systems and patterns
    - Present what's available in the codebase
    - Identify integration points and constraints

3. **Facilitate design discussion**
    - Ask questions about edge cases and behavior
    - Present trade-offs for technical decisions
    - Help think through implications
    - Document decisions as they're made

4. **Organize into issues**
    - Propose how to divide the work
    - Identify dependencies
    - Help sequence implementation

## Output

A collaborative breakdown including:
- Clarified requirements and design decisions
- Technical findings and constraints
- Proposed issue structure for review
- Questions that still need answers
